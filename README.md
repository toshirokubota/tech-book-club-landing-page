## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I used picture tag to provide images of different sizes/resolutions appropriate for different screen sizes. Previously, I did it through javascript and I felt it was not the best practice.

I was able to add color gradient to some text. 

### Continued development

I feel that I have gotten more comfortable with flexbox. Sometimes, I felt in this project that I might be over-using the layout type. I am still often confused with justify-* and align-* properties, so I need to keep working on it.

I did not get to use grid much in this project. So I want to keep workiong on it as well.

I have been problem setting padding and margin. Often I found tweeking them just to makde the layout looks "correct" but end up having a highly complicated style sheet. I want to start focusing on simpler design with DRY.
